## General Information

A consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
   

Analysis has to be conducted summarising the risk assessment the bank could carry out to reduce the risk of loan default. The analysis should highlight the driving factors behind loan default. To conduct the analysis, loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011 is used. 



## Conclusions

Following observations are made regarding reducing bad loans:

1. Grades B, C and D are more likely to default
2. People who own home don't tend to default as mush as others do. But others should be analyzed
3. Loans taken for 'debt_consolidation', 'other', 'credit_card' and 'small_business' are more likely to default
4. People who have been working for about 5 years or more than 10 years tend to default more on loan. Especially 10+
5. People who have 4 to 11 credit lines are more liekly to default
6. People living in state_code CA are more likely to default
